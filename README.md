# Basic React + Parcel template

A simple setup for React apps using [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) as the bundler with Mocha + Enzyme test setup.

## Development

- Install node.js, ideally using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) or through `apt-get` or `brew`
- `npm install`
- `npm start`, will run Parcel on watch mode, simply visit `http://localhost:1234`
- When you're done `npm run build`, bundled files will be placed in `dist`
- Open `dist/index.html` to see the component in context

Run tests:

- Once with `npm test`
- On watch mode `npm run test-watch`
